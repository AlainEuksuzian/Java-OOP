     * Create a class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String), 
        number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type Person given 
        next). Then, create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has the 
        following additional properties: the load capacity in tons (type double since it may 
        contain a fractional part) and towing capacity in pounds (type int). Be sure your 
        class has a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor and mutator methods, 
        and suitably defined equals and toString methods. Write a program to test all 
        your methods
